# MSA-of-P53-ptn-using-Bio-Python
This repository demonstrates the process of performing Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA) for the P53 protein using BioPython. The P53 protein plays a critical role in regulating the cell cycle and preventing tumor formation, making it a key protein in cancer research.

## 🔬 Project Objective

Retrieve P53 protein sequences of different isoforms from Homosapeins.

Perform Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA) using ClustalW or MUSCLE.

Visualize and analyze the evolutionary relationship of the sequences.


## 📦 Tools and Libraries Used

Python 3.x

BioPython

NCBI Entrez Utilities

ClustalW / MUSCLE (for alignment)



## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone this repository:



git clone https://github.com/yourusername/p53-protein-msa.git
cd p53-protein-msa

2. Install required packages:



!pip install biopython

3. Ensure ClustalW or MUSCLE is installed and accessible in your system's PATH.


4. Run the main script:

MSA_p53_isoforms.ipynb

## 🧬 Data Sources

NCBI Protein Database – for retrieving P53 protein sequences.

Sequences may be stored in a local FASTA file (p53_sequences.fasta) or fetched dynamically.


## 📊 Output

Aligned protein sequences in .aln format.

Dendrogram file showing the phylogenetic relationships.
